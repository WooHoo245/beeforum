Free to you, Easy to use

My two friends and I, together we had built this last project for graduating. This website is working smoothly along with essential features. In addition, it has a gorgeous UI, visually looking, and easy to use.

Thanks to the origial post by thedevdojo. He inspired me to create this project.
